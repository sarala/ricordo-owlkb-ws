====Using the deployable war file====
1)Download the ricordo-owlkb-ws.war file from the deploy directory

2)Inside the war file there is a config.properties file.
Edit this file by changing kb.file to where you have the owlfile you want to add to the knowledge base.
There is an example owlfile in resource folder
kb.file=/home/sarala/IdeaProjects/ricordo/ricordo-owlkb-ws/resources/ricordo-test-kb.owl

3)Deploy the changed war file into tomcat

4)Open a web browser and start using the web services

http://localhost:8080/ricordo-owlkb-ws/service/terms/RICORDO_2 and part-of some RICORDO_21
