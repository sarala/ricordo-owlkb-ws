====Using the deployable war file====
Tested on:
tomcat - 6 (http://tomcat.apache.org/)
java - 1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
OS - Windows 7 and Ubuntu

1)Download the ricordo-owlkb-ws.war file from the deploy directory

2)Inside the war file there is a config.properties file.
Edit this file by changing kb.file to where you have the owlfile you want to add to the knowledge base.
There is an example owlfile in resource folder

linux:
kb.file=/home/sarala/IdeaProjects/ricordo/ricordo-owlkb-ws/resources/ricordo-test-kb.owl

windows:
kb.file=C:\\Users\\sarala.EBI\\ideaprojects\\ricordo\\ricordo-owlkb-ws\\resources\\ricordo-test-kb.owl

3)Deploy the changed war file into tomcat

4)Open a web browser and start using the web services

Eg- query RICORDO_2 and part-of some RICORDO_21
http://localhost:8080/ricordo-owlkb-ws/service/terms/RICORDO_2 and part-of some RICORDO_21

jason output
http://localhost:8080/ricordo-owlkb-ws/service/terms/RICORDO_2 and part-of some RICORDO_21.json

xml output
http://localhost:8080/ricordo-owlkb-ws/service/terms/RICORDO_2 and part-of some RICORDO_21.xml

5) Stop services - this will shut down the kb knowledge base server
http://localhost:8080/ricordo-owlkb-ws/service/stopService

====Quick Note====

If the server is not shutdown properly, open ports will need to be closed manually.

Closing ports

Windows
To list ports:
netstat -aon

Check whether you have a open port at 8081 eg
TCP     0.0.0.0:8081    0.0.0.0:0   LISTENING   8216

To kill the process:
taskkill /F /PID 8216

Linux
To list:
ps ax|grep java

To kill the process which uses port 8081:
kill -9 processid
